I am currently a [Research Assistant Professor (RAP)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/people/academic-staff/) in the Department of Applied Mathematics at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). My research focuses on **numerical analysis** and **scientific computing**, with particular interests in:  

- [Surface evolution under geometric flows](projects/1_project/)
- Fluid-structure interaction  
- Nonlinear Schrödinger equations  
- Artificial boundary conditions  
- Semiclassical Schrödinger equations  

I completed both my B.S. and Ph.D. degrees at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), where I worked under the guidance of Prof. [Chunxiong Zheng](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chunxiong-Zheng) on absorbing boundary conditions and the semiclassical Schrödinger equation. Afterward, I joined PolyU as a postdoctoral fellow, collaborating with Prof. [Buyang Li](https://libuyang.com/) on geometrical PDEs, fluid-structure interactions, and nonlinear dispersive equations.  

I’m enthusiastic about connecting with fellow researchers and students. If you’re interested in collaborating on exciting numerical PDE projects, feel free to reach out!
