The study of surface evolution under geometric flows is a fascinating area of research with applications in computer graphics, material science, and biological modeling. Geometric flows describe how surfaces evolve over time according to certain rules, often driven by curvature. One of the most well-known geometric flows is the mean curvature flow, where each point on the surface moves in the direction of the surface normal with a speed proportional to the mean curvature at that point:
\begin{equation}
\partial_t X = -H n
\end{equation}
where $X$ is the position vector of the surface, 
$H$ is the mean curvature, and 
$n$ is the unit normal vector.

This project aims to simulate the evolution of surfaces under geometric flows using parametric finite element methods.
